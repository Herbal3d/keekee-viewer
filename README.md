# KeeKee Viewer

KeeKee Viewer is another generation of viewers. Built from the old
[LookingGlass Viewer] that was created back in 2010 using the
[Ogre graphics engine].

This version is for my experimentation with [libreMetaverse]
and the creation of C# code that can be shared with other viewer
projects.
